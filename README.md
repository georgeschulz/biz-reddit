# Business Themed Front-End Reddit Lookalike

I completed this project as a part of codecademy's full stack engineering course. Check it our here: https://62926a4f18aa312fba379ad2--lustrous-shortbread-3730e8.netlify.app/

The simple application is a lean-ed out reader for reddit content that shows bookmarked searches with a simple interface so those business minded folk can consume business-themed reddit content without all of the distractions. This is my first project using react and redux together.
